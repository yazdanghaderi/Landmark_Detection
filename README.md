# Landmark_Detection
in this repository i presented a model for landmark detection. for develop this model i used Stanford dogs dataset and its annotions. also to aschive 
better perfrmane i used MobileNetV2 that is pre-trained on this dataset as a backbone to select best features from the dataset and then i put a regression layer head to 
predicting landmarks coordinates.
